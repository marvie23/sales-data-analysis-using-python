data.groupby('Category')['Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
> Electronics generated the highest total revenue.

---

###  2. Average Sales by State
```python
data.groupby('State')['Amount'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
```
> States like **California** and **New York** have the highest average sales per order.

---

###  3. Monthly Sales Trend
```python
monthly_sales = data.groupby('Year-Month')['Amount'].sum()
monthly_sales.plot(kind='line', marker='o')
```
> Sales show seasonal peaks â€” indicating influence from holidays or promotions.

---

###  4. Top-Selling Products
```python
# By Quantity
data.groupby('Sub-Category')['Quantity'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

# By Revenue
data.groupby('Sub-Category')['Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)
```
> High quantity: Phones, Chairs  
> High revenue: Laptops, Printers

---

### ðŸ”¹ . Sales by Day of the Week
```python
data['Order Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Order Date'])
data['DayOfWeek'] = data['Order Date'].dt.day_name()
data.groupby('DayOfWeek')['Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
> Peak sales occur on **Friday** and **Saturday**

---

###  6. Low-Selling Products
```python
data.groupby('Sub-Category')['Quantity'].mean().sort_values().head(10)
```
> Some products like Scanners or Copiers are sold in very low quantities.

---

###  7. Profit Margin by Product
```python
profit_margin = data.groupby('Sub-Category')[['Amount', 'Profit']].sum()
profit_margin['Margin %'] = (profit_margin['Profit'] / profit_margin['Amount']) * 100
profit_margin.sort_values(by='Margin %')
```
> Products like **Printers** have low profit margins despite high revenue.

##  Recommendations

- Promote high-margin best-sellers more heavily.
- Investigate low-margin, high-revenue products for cost optimization.
- Optimize inventory for slow-moving products.
- Focus marketing on high-performing states and weekend shoppers.
